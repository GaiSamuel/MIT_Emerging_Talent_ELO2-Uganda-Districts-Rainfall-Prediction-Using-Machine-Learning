| Persona | Needs | The "So What?" |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Smallholder Farmer**<br>*(e.g., "Farmer Joyce")* | Needs to know *when* to plant and *what* seed variety to use. | If she plants beans during a predicted flood month, she loses her entire harvest to root rot. |
| **The District Planner**<br>*(e.g., "Local Govt Officer")* | Needs to budget for road maintenance and fertilizer subsidies. | If he knows Elgon region faces landslides in October, he can pre-position road-clearing equipment. |
| **The Disaster Manager**<br>*(e.g., "Red Cross Volunteer")* | Needs early warning for floods/droughts to save lives. | Knowing that Ntoroko faces a drought in 2026 allows for early food relief planning. |
